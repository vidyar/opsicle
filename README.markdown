#Opsicle, an OpsWorks CLI
A gem bringing the glory of OpsWorks to your command line.

## Installation
Add this line to your project's Gemfile:

**For Ruby >=2.1.0**

```ruby
gem 'opsicle'
gem 'curses'
```

**For Ruby <2.1.0, 1.9.3**

```ruby
gem 'opsicle'
```

(Alternatively, `gem 'opsicle'; gem 'curses' unless RUBY_VERSION < "2.1.0"`)

**Why the extra `curses` gem for Ruby 2.1.0+?**

Opsicle uses [curses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curses_(programming_library)).
Ruby's library to interface with curses was [removed from stdlib in Ruby 2.1.0](https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/8584).
[The new curses gem](https://github.com/ruby/curses) is not backwards compatible, so in an effort to keep this gem
friendly with all current Ruby versions we don't list it as a dependency in Opsicle's gemspec - doing so would cause
errors for Ruby 1.9.3 users.
Ruby >=2.1.0 will likely be enforced sometime in 2014; [certainly by February 2015](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2014/01/10/ruby-1-9-3-will-end-on-2015/).

## Using Opsicle

Run `opsicle help` for a full list of commands and their uses.

Some common commands:

### Deployments
```bash

# Run a basic deploy for the current app
opsicle deploy staging

# Run the deploy for production
opsicle deploy production

```
You may also use `-m or --monitor` to open the Opsicle Stack Monitor, or
`-b or --browser` to open the OpsWorks deployments screen for that app when deploying.

### SSH
```bash
# SSH to a server instance in the given environment stack
opsicle ssh staging

# Set your user SSH key (PUBLIC KEY) for OpsWorks
opsicle ssh-key staging <key-file>

```

### Stack Monitor
```bash
# Launch the Opsicle Stack Monitor for the given environment stack
opsicle monitor staging

```

Opsicle accepts a `--verbose` flag or the VERBOSE environment variable to show additional information as commands are run.

Opsicle accepts a DEBUG environment variable to show additional logging such as stack traces for failed commands.
